# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Overview

Personal portfolio website (ziantsabit.com). Two independent sub-projects in one repo, each with its own Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml — there is no root-level build, package manager, or orchestration that ties them together.

- `zian-tsabit-com/` — React 19 + TypeScript + Vite SPA (the live site)
- `zian_tsabit_be/` — Django backend, still scaffolding

## Commands

Frontend (run from `zian-tsabit-com/`):

```bash
npm install
npm run dev        # Vite dev server
npm run build      # tsc -b (project references) then vite build
npm run lint       # eslint .
npm run preview    # serve the built dist/
docker compose up --build   # multi-stage build -> nginx on :8080
```

Backend (run from `zian_tsabit_be/`):

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python manage.py runserver
python manage.py makemigrations myapp && python manage.py migrate
python manage.py test              # whole suite
python manage.py test myapp.tests.ClassName.test_name   # single test
docker compose up --build          # Django dev server on :8000
```

No test runner is configured for the frontend.

## Frontend architecture

### Adding a page

`src/App.tsx` is the whole routing table — a `<Header />` sits above `<Routes>`, so it persists across navigation and every page renders beneath a fixed bar (56px on `xs`, 64px from `sm`). A new page is three coordinated edits:

1. `src/pages/X.tsx` — default-exported function component.
2. A `<Route path="/x" element={<X />} />` in `App.tsx`.
3. An entry in the `navItems` array in `src/components/Header.tsx` — that one array feeds both the desktop nav and the mobile `Drawer`, so adding it in one place covers both. Home is deliberately absent from it; the "Zian Tsabit" logo `Link` is what routes to `/`.

### Colour and the light/dark theme

`src/theme.ts` is the single source of colour. `main.tsx` wraps the app in `<ThemeProvider theme={theme} defaultMode="system">` plus `<CssBaseline />`, and the theme declares both schemes via MUI's `colorSchemes` with `cssVariables: { colorSchemeSelector: "class" }`.

**Never write a colour literal in a component.** `color: "white"` or `grey.900` resolves to the same thing in both schemes, so a literal silently breaks light mode — dark text on a dark card. Use semantic tokens only:

| Instead of | Use |
| --- | --- |
| `color: "white"` | `color: "text.primary"` |
| `color: "grey.400/500/600"` | `color: "text.secondary"` |
| `bgcolor: "black"` | `bgcolor: "background.default"` |
| `bgcolor: "grey.900"` | `bgcolor: "background.paper"` |
| `#6497b1` | `primary.main` |
| `borderColor: "grey.800"`, `bgcolor: "grey"` | `divider` |

The one custom token is `palette.headerScrolled` (declared through module augmentation in `theme.ts`), the translucent wash behind the scrolled header. Read it via `(theme.vars ?? theme).palette.headerScrolled` — with `cssVariables` on, `theme.vars` is the populated one, and the fallback keeps TypeScript happy since `vars` is optional on the type.

Note the two schemes do **not** share a link colour: dark uses `#6497b1`, light uses the darker `#1565c0`, because `#6497b1` on white is only ~3.1:1 — under the 4.5:1 AA floor for body text. If you add a colour, check it against both backgrounds.

**Mode selection** is `defaultMode="system"`, so a first-time visitor follows their OS. `ColorModeToggle.tsx` calls `setMode()` to store an explicit override under the `mui-mode` localStorage key, which then wins over the OS. `mode` is `undefined` on the first render, so the toggle renders a hidden same-size placeholder until mounted rather than flashing the wrong icon.

**Avoiding a flash of the wrong theme** takes two cooperating pieces, because MUI emits its palette as CSS variables injected by JavaScript — before React mounts there is nothing colouring the page:

1. `index.css` carries `prefers-color-scheme` media queries plus `html.light` / `html.dark` rules that set *only* the page background. They live in the static, render-blocking stylesheet, so the correct backdrop paints immediately.
2. An inline script in `index.html` reads `localStorage['mui-mode']` and applies the class before that stylesheet is parsed, so a stored choice that contradicts the OS is honoured pre-paint too.

Those background hex values are duplicated from `palette.background.default`; if you change one, change the other. That is the only place a colour literal belongs outside `theme.ts`.

### Page layout and the fixed header

The header is `position: fixed`, so its height has to be subtracted from page height in two places. Both come from `src/constants/layout.ts`:

- `HEADER_HEIGHT` — used by `Header.tsx` for its own height, and by the `<Box component="main">` wrapper in `App.tsx` for `pt`. That wrapper is what pushes every route clear of the bar, so **pages must not add their own top margin for the header**; an earlier `marginTop: "36px"` under a 64px bar left content sitting behind it.
- `PAGE_MIN_HEIGHT` — `calc(100vh - <header>)`. A page that uses a bare `100vh` alongside the wrapper's padding is one header taller than the viewport and introduces a permanent scrollbar.

Pages are built from `Box`/`Container`/`Stack` with inline `sx` — no CSS modules, no styled-components except `Typewriter`. Existing pages follow one of two shapes; copy the closer one:

- **Content page** (`Home`, `CV`, `Books`): `Box` with `minHeight: PAGE_MIN_HEIGHT`, `bgcolor: "transparent"`, `pt: { xs: 2, sm: 3 }`, wrapping a `Container maxWidth="md"`.
- **Coming-soon placeholder** (`Projects`, `Garage` — byte-identical apart from the name): `bgcolor: "background.default"`, a flex-centered `Container maxWidth="md"`, and a single `<Typewriter text="Coming soon..." />`.

Use `Container` (or explicit `px`) rather than a bare `maxWidth` on a `Box` — `Container` supplies the responsive side gutters that keep text off the screen edge on phones.

### Responsive conventions

Responsive values use the MUI breakpoint object form (`{ xs: "12px", sm: "14px", md: "16px", lg: "22px" }`, `direction={{ xs: "column", sm: "row" }}`) rather than media queries. Two rules the existing code now follows:

- **Justified text is `sm`-and-up only** — `textAlign: { xs: "left", sm: "justify" }`. A justified ~35-character phone line opens visible rivers of whitespace.
- **Nothing may widen the page.** `html, body` carry `overflow-x: hidden` as a backstop, but that only hides the symptom. If a block genuinely needs a fixed minimum width, give it its own `overflowX: "auto"` container so it pans inside its box while `document.scrollWidth` stays equal to the viewport.

### Component notes

- `Header.tsx` owns everything in `sx` — there is no longer a `Header.css`. A scroll listener flips `isScrolled` past 50px, which swaps `bgcolor` between `transparent` and `palette.headerScrolled` under a `background-color` transition. It had to move out of CSS because a hardcoded `rgba(0,0,0,0.85)` cannot follow the colour scheme.
- `SectionHeading.tsx` and `TagChip.tsx` (with its `TagChipRow` export) are shared by the CV and About pages — they were duplicated inline before, so both pages drifting apart was a matter of time. Reuse them rather than restyling a heading or pill locally.
- `TimelineItem.tsx` renders one LinkedIn-style entry: an absolutely positioned dot plus a `&::before` rail that runs from under the dot to the bottom of the entry, so consecutive items join into one continuous line. Pass `last` on the final entry of a section to suppress the trailing rail. Title and date sit on one row at `sm`+ and stack at `xs`.
- `Typewriter.tsx` is the one emotion `styled()` component. Width is driven by a `--characters` CSS custom property computed from `text.length`, typed via `interface CustomStyles extends React.CSSProperties`; the animation loops forever, so it reads as a placeholder, not a one-shot reveal.
- **`@mui/joy` was removed; don't add it back.** Joy and Material read the same theme context, so a Joy component under the Material `ThemeProvider` crashes the whole app with `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'xl')` — a blank white page, not a degraded one. Joy also has its own independent colour-scheme system, so it would never follow the light/dark toggle. `Header.tsx` used Joy's `List`/`ListItem`; those are now plain `Box component="ul"/"li"` with the menubar roles kept. `@mui/material` is the only component library.
- `src/css/Home.css` and `src/css/Projects.css` are empty leftovers imported by nothing.

### Content and assets

All copy is hardcoded in components. `CV.tsx` is the outlier and the one page with a real data shape: module-level `summary`, `experience`, `projects`, `skills`, and `education` arrays declared above the component, mapped into `<TimelineItem />`. Its content is a manual transcription of the owner's CV, so keeping it current is a hand edit.

**No CV PDF is shipped, deliberately.** The site used to serve `public/Ghazian_Tsabit_Alkamil.pdf` behind a "Download CV" button; both were removed because the document contains a personal phone number. Don't reintroduce a downloadable CV without checking what personal data is in it — a PDF in `public/` is world-readable to anyone who guesses the URL, with no link required.

Static files live in `public/` and are referenced by absolute path (`/pp-github.png` on Home, `/professional-photo.jpeg` on About). These are untyped string literals that Vite will not check, so renaming anything in `public/` means grepping for the old filename — the CV download button silently 404'd for months after `c77e4ac` renamed its target.

The Ubuntu font comes from a Google Fonts `<link>` in `index.html`, not from npm, and **that URL must keep requesting the `ital` axis**. `index.css` sets `font-synthesis: none`, so with a regular-only font the browser will not fake a slant: `<em>` and every `fontStyle: "italic"` (the Books quote, `TimelineItem`'s company blurb) render identically to body text. That was the case until the axis was added — the markup looked right and the output was silently wrong.

External links are inconsistent: `CV.tsx` routes them through react-router's `Link` (`to="https://..."`, `to="mailto:..."`) while `Home.tsx` uses a plain `<a>`. The plain anchor is the correct one for off-site URLs.

### Serving the built site

Routing is client-side, so `/about`, `/books`, … exist only in `App.tsx` — there is no matching file in `dist/`. Any static host must rewrite unknown paths to `index.html` or a direct hit (or a refresh, or a shared link) returns 404 while in-app navigation works fine.

`nginx.conf` does this for the Docker image via `try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html`, and the Dockerfile copies it to `/etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf`. Two details there are deliberate: `/assets/` uses `try_files $uri =404` so a missing bundle fails as a 404 instead of silently returning HTML that the browser then tries to parse as JavaScript, and `index.html` is sent `Cache-Control: no-store` so a returning visitor never gets an old shell pointing at asset hashes that no longer exist.

`npm run dev` and `npm run preview` both have this fallback built in, so this class of bug only ever shows up in the container.

### Build gotcha

`tsconfig.app.json` sets `strict`, `noUnusedLocals`, and `noUnusedParameters`. `npm run dev` tolerates an unused import; `npm run build` runs `tsc -b` first and fails on it. Run `npm run build` before assuming a change is complete.

## Backend status

The Django project is scaffolding, not a working API:

- `myapp` is **not** in `INSTALLED_APPS` (`zian_tsabit_be/settings.py`), so its models are inert and `migrations/` is empty apart from `__init__.py`. Adding it is the first step for any backend work.
- `myapp/views.py` is empty and `urls.py` only routes `admin/`. No REST framework or serializers are installed — `requirements.txt` is just `Django>=4.2`.
- Models defined but unused: `Book`, `Project`, `Update`, `GarageSale`. These mirror the site's `/books`, `/projects`, `/garage` pages.
- Database is SQLite (`db.sqlite3`, committed). Postgres and MinIO compose files existed but were removed in `29dd34b`.

## Frontend/backend seam

`src/services/{Books,Projects,Updates,GarageSales}.tsx` each contain a single comment naming an intended data-fetching hook and nothing else; none is imported anywhere. Nothing in the frontend calls the backend yet — there is no HTTP client dependency, no API base URL, and no `.env`/`import.meta.env` usage. The service names line up with the four Django models and with the `Coming soon...` pages, so wiring one up means: build the API in `myapp`, add CORS, fill in the service, and swap that page's placeholder for real content.
